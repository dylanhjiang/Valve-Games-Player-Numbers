## Overview 
  Original dataset contain the monthly average number of players for the current top 100 games in the videogame platform Steam. 
The data includes data from July 2012 to September 2021.

  This analysis will focus on only three videogames which involve the Valve titles Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and Team Fortress 2.
The dataset will be used to find insights to how player numbers changed within these nine years and how the three franchises may have differed.

## Findings

  Insights from the dashboard visualizations seem to indicate that Dota 2 was consistently in the lead in average player numbers compared to the 
runner-up(Counter Strike: Global Offensive) in the years from 2012 to 2019. Counter Strike: Global Offensive overtakes average player count of Dota 2 in the next
two years in 2020 and 2021 with numbers nearly doubling. Team Fortress 2 numbers remain stagnant throughout most of this time period but also experiences a sizable 
increase in 2020 and 2021. Team Fortress 2 player count increased in these years by 41.9% and 34.2% respectively. The overall increase to average player counts
during 2020 and 2021 could possibly be a correlative effect driven by the increase time spent at home during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

  The trends in average player count by the months in the year is aggregated and averaged using all the months in the period from July 2012 to September 2021
(Example: July 2014, July 2015, July 2016 etc. are combined and averaged). The highest and lowest points in player numbers seem to concentrate in specific parts 
in the year. Average player count appear to reach its peak at around the year's second quarter and then tends to dip down during the fourth quarter.
